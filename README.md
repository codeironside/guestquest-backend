# GuestQuest Backend 🛠️

Welcome to the **backend** of **GuestQuest**—where all the magic (or chaos) happens! This Node.js-powered backend will (hopefully) handle everything from bookings to billing for restaurants, clubs, suites, and hotels. Brace yourself, because this is my first crack at it, and I’m just hoping it doesn’t crash. 🤞

## Features (That I’m Trying to Build) 💡
- **API for Booking Management**: Reserve rooms, tables, and the occasional VIP lounge.
- **Inventory Management**: Keep tabs on all the important stuff (like drinks).
- **Employee Scheduling**: Manage who’s working when (because someone needs to be at work).
- **Billing & Payments**: Track payments, receipts, and maybe even some tips.

## Tech Stack 🧰
- **Framework**: Node.js & Express
- **Database**: MongoDB (because SQL and I are not friends right now)
- **Authentication**: JWT (Hopefully secure enough… we’ll see)
- **API Documentation**: Postman (will update you when I finish it!)

## Installation ⚙️
If you dare to run this locally:

1. Clone the repo:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/GuestQuest-backend.git
   ```
2. Navigate into the backend directory:
   ```bash
   cd GuestQuest-backend
   ```
3. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```
4. Set up environment variables in a `.env` file:
   ```
   MONGODB_URI=your_mongo_connection_string
   JWT_SECRET=your_super_secret_key
   PORT=your_port_number
   ```

5. Start the server:
   ```bash
   npm start
   ```

## API Endpoints 📡
- `GET /api/bookings` - Fetch all bookings
- `POST /api/bookings` - Create a new booking
- `GET /api/inventory` - Check inventory levels
- `POST /api/payments` - Process a payment

... and more coming soon, if I don’t get stuck!
